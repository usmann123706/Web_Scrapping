#Web Scraping for Price Retrieval using Python and Selenium
This project was initiated to streamline and expedite the process of obtaining prices for individual parts listed on a website. The conventional method involved manually searching and typing part numbers 
into the website, which consumed a significant amount of time. To mitigate this inefficiency, a web scraping solution was developed using Python, specifically leveraging the Selenium library.

#Methodology
The project involved several key steps:

#Identifying the Challenge: 
Recognizing the time-consuming nature of manually searching and extracting prices for individual parts from a website.

#Selection of Tools: 
Choosing Python as the primary programming language for its versatility in web scraping and utilizing the Selenium library for its capability to automate web interactions.

#Web Scraping Implementation: 
The script was developed to input a list of part numbers stored in an array. Leveraging Selenium's automation capabilities, the script navigates through the website and dynamically fetches the prices 
of these parts.

#Data Organization: 
The collected prices are stored and managed efficiently, allowing for easy access and analysis.

#Technical Details
Programming Language: Python
Libraries Used: Selenium
Implementation Approach: Utilizing Selenium's functionality to automate the browsing experience, interacting with web elements, and extracting relevant pricing information.
#Results and Impact
The implementation of web scraping using Python and Selenium significantly reduced the time previously spent manually inputting part numbers to obtain prices. 
By automating this process, the efficiency and accuracy of price retrieval were greatly enhanced.

Conclusion
This project showcases the power of leveraging automation through web scraping techniques to simplify and expedite tasks that involve repetitive web interactions. 
The Python script developed as part of this project not only improved efficiency but also laid the foundation for potential future enhancements and scalability.
